Version 0.2.3 (2017/02/22)
------------------------------
- Added CSS to remove the list-style from this menu by default


Version 0.2.2 (2017/02/12)
------------------------------
- Put the rest of the script inside of conditional that only runs if $scm_menu exists on the page
- Removed a console.log() call


Version 0.2.1 (2017/02/07)
------------------------------
- Fixed an incorrect call to compare the queried object with itself to determine if it's the current page, resulting in a false positive for the topmost item every time


Version 0.2 (2017/02/06)
------------------------------
- Added a new checkbox to the widget to disable jQuery
- Added a new data-disable-js attribute on the top-level ul
- Added a new conditional around the plugin's jQuery script to run only if data-disable-js is != "on"
- Changed the CSS to account for data-disable-js so that when disabled, child menus are not hidden since there'd be no way to expand them
- Added a new checkbox to the widget to disable child menu indentation
- Added a new data-disable-indentation attribute on the top-level ul
- Changed the CSS to account for data-disable-indentation so that when disabled, child menus are not indented
